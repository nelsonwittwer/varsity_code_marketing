                    <p>
                      Coding, by itself, can seem daunting and abstract. When you can use something like Minecraft that your child
                      most likely already has a deep understanding and passion for, you remove that layer of abstraction and
                      you get to see immediate results. Best of all, you get to channel their passion for the game to help them
                      develop a skill that will prepare them for a wide variety of careers in technology.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3>What Programming Language Will Be Taught?</h3>
                    <p>We will be working in the Python language. Python is a very easy to learn language that is also incredibly powerful.
                    It is also the preferred programming language at Google.</p>

                    This little computer was designed to introduce people to people of all ages to hardware and software development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will be building and configuring these from the ground up, so you'll be able to learn about everything that goes
                    into making a computer work.

                  <h3>Learn Linux, The Operating System That Powers The Web</h3>
                  <p>While you may or may not have heard of it, you use Linux every day. It powers the majority of servers that host
                  websites, apps, and email. Working with Linux will prepare your child to run and operate a server of their own.</p>

                  <h3>Work With Your Raspberry Pi At Home</h3>
                  <p>We want your child to work with their Raspberry Pi at home and continue learning outside of class. The Raspberry Pi has an HDMI output, meaning if
                  you have a TV or computer monitor with an HDMI input, all you'll need is a keyboard and mouse. If you don't have a keyboard and mouse at your home, you can pick both up
                  for around $15 on Amazon.</p>

                    While Nelson graduated from BYU studying Management Information Systems, Nelson's tech career
                    really began when we was 14 and started coding to build his own video game modifations and
                    servers. It was the perfect way to get emersed into the world of technology, since it was
                    something he was already deeply passionate about as a kid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nelson started his career as a technical consultant for Ernst & Young, advsing Fortune 500 companies
                    on the technical security of their financial stystems. After a few years, Nelson left EY to peruse
                    his passion of Software Development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nelson has worked at various tech startups as a software Developer, including MoneyDekstop where
                    he developed externally facing APIs for hundreds of their banking partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nelson is also the proud father of two children and is counting down the days until he can teach them to code as well :)

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>How much does enrollment cost?</h4>
                  <p>$360 for the 6 week course. The Raspberry Pi microcomputer and accessories that your child will be working with is included inthe cost.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>Where will classes be held?</h4>
                  <p>The classes will be held at a residence in Draper, Utah. We'll email you the exact address after you enroll.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>I really loved seeing how much progress my child made, do you offer further courses?</h4>
                  <p>That is definitely the plan! Stay tuned for advanced Minecraft classes as well as classes in robotics and web development.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>What Pre-requisites Do you Recommend?</h4>
                  <p>The biggested indicator for success is an excitement about the course itself. If your child is excited about learning to code, or exploring
                  new possibilities they will be primed to succeed.</p>
                  <p>A firm foundation in math will also help out. We will be using variables and plotting in three dimension grids. As long as
                  they are ok learning and working in these concepts they will be fine. This is a great way to help them utilize all that math
                  they never thought they'd actually use :)</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>Can I take the class with my child?</h4>
                  <p>We have a limited number of seats for each class, so if you are interested in participating with your child, you'll need to enroll for two
                  spots.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, we'll have the lectures online if you'd like to watch and keep up with your student.</p>

                  <h4>What kind of out of class support do you offer?</h4>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>What Will My Child Need to Bring each Week?</h4>
                  <p>Just your Raspberry Pi microcomputer. We will provide everything else.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>Will there be Homework?</h4>
                  <p>Yes! Practice makes perfect! We'll have a weekly assignments which will be creative in nature.
                  Each assignment is designed to help yoru child get an understanding of the concepts covered in each class.</p>

                  <h4>Do we get to keep the Raspberry Pi?</h4>
                  <p>Yes! We want to encourage your child to keep learning, long after this course concludes. During the course, we expect your
                  child to use their Raspberry Pi to complete the homework and show off their creations during the start of each class.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>How do we use the Raspberry Pi at Home?</h4>
                  <p>The Raspberry Pi comes with an HDMI output. You can hook it up to any TV or Computer Monitor with an HDMI input.
                  If you have a monitor with a DVI input, you could buy a converter and still use it. Contact us and we'll give you pointers on it.</p>
                  <p>You'll also need a keyboard and mouse. If you don't have an old set laying around, you can pick up both for about $15 on Amazon.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>Can We Bring Our Own Computers?</h4>
                  <p>Unfortunately, no. In order to simplify the learning and teaching process, we'd like everyone to work in the same environment.
                  We are really excited about the Raspberry Pi format, as we can also inclucde lessons in computer hardware. Plus, working on
                  a microcomputer is just really cool.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>What if We Can't Make one of the Classes?</h4>
                  <p>We will record every class session and post lectures on our website. You'll just have to make sure you are up to date
                  before the next class, as each class builds on the previous class.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>I can't make it during this block, will you have future classes?</h4>
                  <p>We plan on doing this for as long as people are interested. Join the mailing list to stay in the loop for future classes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <h4>That price is out my price range, do you have any cheaper options?</h4>
                  <p>After we've done a class or two, I'd like to package the lectures and homework into their own product. You'll be able to buy those videos
                  on their own in the near future. I imagine those videos will run around $100.</p>
